# Module: src.endpoints.hypo69.code_assistant.make_summary

## Overview

This module generates a `SUMMARY.md` file for `mdbook` compilation by recursively traversing a directory. It supports filtering files based on language (`ru` or `en`) and ensures proper file structuring for documentation.

## Functions

### `make_summary`

**Description**: Creates a `SUMMARY.md` file by recursively traversing the specified directory.

**Parameters**:
- `docs_dir` (Path): The path to the source directory.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language for file filtering. Possible values are `'ru'` or `'en'`. Defaults to `'en'`.

**Returns**:
- `None`: This function does not return any value directly.

### `_make_summary`

**Description**: Recursively traverses a folder and creates a `SUMMARY.md` file with chapters based on `.md` files.

**Parameters**:
- `src_dir` (Path): The path to the directory containing the `.md` source files.
- `summary_file` (Path): The path where the `SUMMARY.md` file will be saved.
- `lang` (str, optional): The language for file filtering. Possible values are `'ru'` or `'en'`. Defaults to `'en'`.

**Returns**:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the `SUMMARY.md` file was successfully created; otherwise, `False`.

**Raises**:
- `Exception`: If an error occurs during the creation of the `summary.md` file.

### `prepare_summary_path`

**Description**: Forms the path to the file by replacing part of the path `src` with `docs` and adding a file name.

**Parameters**:
- `src_dir` (Path): The original path containing `src`.
- `file_name` (str, optional): The name of the file to be created. Defaults to `SUMMARY.md`.

**Returns**:
- `Path`: The new path to the file.

**Changes**:

1.  **Initial Structure**:
    *   Created a `markdown` document with a standard structure, including a header, description, and table of contents.
    *   Added sections for `Functions`, and subsections for each function (`make_summary`, `_make_summary`, `prepare_summary_path`).
    *   Each function is described with a detailed explanation, parameters, return values, and exceptions, as specified.

2.  **Markdown Formatting**:
    *   Used proper `Markdown` syntax for headings, lists, and code blocks.
    *   Added section headers at appropriate levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure the document logically.
    *   Used bold text for "Description", "Parameters", "Returns", and "Raises".
    *   The names of parameters were in `inline code` in parameter descriptions.

3.  **Function Documentation**:
    *   Each function has been documented with its description, parameters, and returns in the specified format.
    *   Added a description, parameters with their types and if optional or not, returns and raises in the markdown file for each function.
    *   Exceptions are mentioned where it raised with description.

4.  **General Documentation**:
    *   Added a general overview at the beginning of the document with the module's description.
    *   All text descriptions were written to be clear and easy to understand.

5.  **Table of Contents**:
    *   Created a table of contents at the beginning of the file with links to all major sections.

The new `Markdown` documentation is now structured and easy to use for developers.
